# streak-camera

These are Igor Pro 6 procedures written for the [Gamelin research group](http://depts.washington.edu/gmrg) in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington, specifically for the visualization and analysis of transient absorption and photoluminescence data from a Hamamatsu streak camera.

**streak** is a macro designed for users without coding or command-line experience in Igor. It displays, corrects, and converts images, as well as generating vertical and horizontal slices of images.

**streaktrace** includes several different methods for tracing the peak energy of a spectrum over time.

Demo and examples to be added soon.
